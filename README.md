Title:

    Python Programming Project

General Instructions: 

    •	Your assignment should be a Python program
    •	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g. conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop). 
    •	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code. For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions, e.g. shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment. However, there are many correct ways to write a program.  All roads lead to Rome.   
    •	Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with debugging your code. 
Instructions in detail: 

    Part I: Assignment file structure 
    •	Create a folder called powerball
    •	Inside the powerball folder, you need to create a subfolder according what we have learned so far.
    •	 The project must be implemented in OOP 
    •	Use comment in the relevant areas – Mandatory requirement.
Part II:  The READ ME header information:  

    •	The READ ME file must have a document type so that a user’s browser knows what version is used. 
    •	The READ ME file  must include all data , and metadata: 
    o	Title – PowerBall Project   
    o	Metadata: description , keywords, and author. Author name is your full name.   
Part III: How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?

    •	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 
    •	The Powerball game includes two parts. 
    o	Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20). 
    o	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10). 
    •	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers. 
    Here is one of the examples when I run my code.  

    Every time you run your program/page, your  would display the winning numbers, and your lucky numbers, and the result respectively. For example, after I rerun my program several times, I got this one:
    Sometimes if I am lucky, I can get this one:  
    Grading: Today’s Powerball Winning Numbers 
    •	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (11 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
    •	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (11 points) - hard code results in zero points.
    •	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.
    Grading: Your lucky numbers: 
    •	The first five numbers (purple) are random numbers drawn from 20 numbers (12 points) – hard code results in zero points. 
    •	The first five numbers (purple) should be in ascending order (15 points)  - hard code results in zero points.
    •	The Powerball number (gold) is a random number drawn from 10 numbers from 1 to 10 inclusively. (5 points) - hard code results in zero points.
    
Part IV: Use if or switch conditional statements to display the result based on your lucky numbers and winning numbers.

    •	Correct White Balls and the Powerball: Jackpot $324,000,000
    •	5 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $1,000,000
    •	4 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $10,000
    •	4 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $100
    •	3 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $100
    •	3 Correct White Balls, but no Powerball: $7
    •	2 Correct White Balls and the Powerball: $7
    •	1 Correct White Ball and the Powerball: $4
    •	No White Balls, Just the Powerball: $4
    •	All Other situations – display “try again!”
